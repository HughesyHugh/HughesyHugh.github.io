This GitHub Pages site will be my personal site and a directory of my projects. Until I develop more blog/article-style functionality on the site, this readme will serve the purpose of outlining my key goals progress.

Aims:
1. Solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS. 
2. Develop additional familiarity with organising the project files to a more professional standard.

3. Further my knowledge of JavaScript by building web apps, hosting them online and linking to them from this website. 

4. As I undertake courses of varied technologies I'll upload course projects also.
